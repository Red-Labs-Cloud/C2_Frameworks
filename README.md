# Command and Control Infrastructure

This repository provides resources and tools for building and managing efficient cyber ranges specifically designed for red team training.

## What is a Cyber Range?
A cyber range is a simulated environment that mimics real-world networks and systems. Red teams utilize cyber ranges to practice offensive security techniques, test attack methodologies, and refine their skills in a safe and controlled environment.

## What's Included?
This repository can contain various resources depending on your specific setup and goals. Here are some potential inclusions:

- Deployment Scripts: Scripts to automate the deployment of cyber range environments within cloud providers or on-premises infrastructure. (e.g., scripts using tools like Terraform or Ansible)
- Scenario Templates: Pre-built scenarios simulating real-world attack vectors and objectives for red teams to practice against.
- Vulnerable Machines: Vulnerable system images or configurations that can be deployed within the cyber range for red teams to exploit.
- Blue Team Tools: Tools and resources to simulate blue team activity within the cyber range, providing a more realistic training experience. (e.g., Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) logs, pre-configured detection rules)
- Documentation: Documentation outlining best practices for building and managing red team cyber ranges.


## Getting Started
